'''A, B and C are classes  

A is a super class. B is a sub class of A. C is a sub class of B. 

Create three methods in each class, 2 methods are specific to each class and third method (override method) 
should be in all three Classes A, B and C  

Create a class with main method. Create an object for each class A, B and C in main method and 
call every method of each class using its own object/instance.

Call an overridden method with super class reference to B and C classâ€™s objects  

Runtime Polymorphism with Data Members/Instance variables, Repeat the above process only for data members
